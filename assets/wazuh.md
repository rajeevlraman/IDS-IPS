**Wazuh**

Wazuh is a free, open-source security monitoring platform designed for threat detection, integrity monitoring, incident response, and compliance. It combines several essential security tools into a cohesive platform to enhance overall security visibility and response capabilities.

### Key Features:

- **Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS):** Monitors and analyzes system logs, file integrity, rootkits, and other host-based indicators for potential security threats.
- **Log Management and Analysis:** Collects, normalizes, and analyzes logs from various sources, providing centralized visibility into security events and anomalies.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Detects unauthorized changes to critical files and directories, helping to identify potential compromises or malware infections.
- **Vulnerability Detection:** Integrates vulnerability assessment capabilities to identify and prioritize security weaknesses across systems.
- **Real-time Alerting:** Provides real-time alerts and notifications for suspicious activities or security incidents, enabling prompt response.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Integration:** Integrates with popular SIEM solutions for enhanced correlation and analysis of security data.
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Helps organizations achieve and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements through continuous monitoring and reporting.

### Components:

- **Wazuh Manager:** Centralized server responsible for collecting and analyzing data from agents and external sources.
- **Wazuh Agents:** Lightweight agents installed on monitored endpoints to collect security-related data and send it to the Wazuh manager for analysis.
- **Elastic Stack Integration:** Utilizes the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for data storage, normalization, and visualization.
- **Open Source Community:** Supported by an active community of contributors and users, providing updates, plugins, and support resources.

### Use Cases:

- **Threat Detection and Response:** Identifies and responds to security incidents in real-time, reducing detection and response times.
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Ensures systems adhere to regulatory requirements through continuous monitoring and auditing.
- **Security Operations Center (SOC) Integration:** Enhances SOC operations with centralized monitoring and automated response capabilities.
- **Incident Investigation:** Facilitates forensic investigation and root cause analysis of security breaches or incidents.
